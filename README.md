This project is about creating a live voice bot by using ESP32, I2S microphone and I2S speaker. By using TCP/IP communication and python to run a server, it is possible to implement OpenAI API, enabling user to  ask questions from onboard microphone, while  simultaneously getting the result on OLED display and I2S Speaker.
